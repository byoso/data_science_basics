# Data Science Basics

This is just for myself, some exercises to get the basics of jupyter, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

You can just check the examples on github directly.

## set up

- Create a virtual environment in the root directory with the dependencies.txt
- run jupyter-lab:
```sh
jupyter-lab
```
